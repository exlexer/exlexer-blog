Hello!

A little about me.
I'm terrible at writing.
K-12 with countless low score essays, a degree in communications (including various writing and speaking classes retaken or scraped by), all yielding a complex, assuming I'm destined to communicational mediocrity.
But as of late I've felt the desire to get my thoughts out on paper and out of my head.

Professionally, I'm currently an independent software engineer, primarily working in web, but with interest in other many other technical spaces.
Thus I expect much of my writing to be around thoughts on technical matters.

There is also the very real possibility that I fail to make this a habit and it ends up kicked to the curb.
